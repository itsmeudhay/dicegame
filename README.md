Dice Game Website
This is a simple dice game website that allows users to roll a virtual die. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Use
To use the dice game, simply click on the “Roll Dice” button. The website will generate a random number between 1 and 6, which corresponds to the number on a standard die.

DOM Manipulation
The website uses JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of the webpage. When a user clicks on the “Roll Dice” button, the corresponding die image is displayed along with the number generated. This is achieved by adding and removing CSS classes using JavaScript.

Here are some of the key JavaScript functions used for DOM manipulation:

- document.querySelector(): This function is used to select an element from the DOM based on its CSS selector.

- element.classList.add(): This function is used to add a CSS class to an element.

- element.classList.remove(): This function is used to remove a CSS class from an element.

- element.addEventListener(): This function is used to add an event listener to an element.
